1. plot included: 'Degree Distribution.png'
In the collaboration network, the expected excess degree is 
much larger than the expected degree. This is because our 
co-authors have more co-authors than us as people who publish 
with many others are counted often.

2. Average clustering coefficient for each network
Clustering Coefficient for Small World Network: 0.304914
Clustering Coefficient for Collaboration Network: 0.611483

The outputs shows that CELF gets the highest influence when the K increases followed by
targeted high degree centrality and random comes the last.
